Address numbers should never be accessed directly. They should only, ever be
accessed through another entity such as a `User` or `Organization` object.

Because of this no GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, or DELETE functionality has been
added to this endpoint.

This file serves as a reminder that we do not want to open these up directly.
